# BadCodeRocks
This is my submission to the BadCode.rocks October 2018 submission. The goal of the program was to write a Pig Latin translator.

The code ended up being so bad that syntax highlighting failed in Visual Studio 2017, and IntelliSense thought that the code would not compile, when, in fact, it did.

It is written as an F# one-liner.
